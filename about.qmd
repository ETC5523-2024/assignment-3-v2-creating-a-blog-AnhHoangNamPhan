## About Me

Hello! I’m Anh Phan, a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering in Vietnam before gaining over three years of professional industry experience. During my time in the industry, I developed a strong interest in using data to optimize entire business operations, not just the manufacturing process as I did during my undergraduate studies. My Master’s program has equipped me with essential data analysis skills in R and Python, preparing me to pursue a future career in Business Analytics.
