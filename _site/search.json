    "title": "Best Chocolate Brands for Carnegie IGA Retail",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As a member of the IGA grocery team in Carnegie, Melbourne, I recently undertook a study to identify the best chocolate brands to stock in the store. According to 2021 Australia Census, Carnegie has very diverse population, including a significant number of Colombian customers who often visit our store for their favorite goods. To cater to the local market effectively, I set out to explore chocolate brands based on various factors to guide our purchasing decisions.\nThe data for this analysis was sourced from the Flavors of Cacao website, which contains ratings for over 2,000 dark chocolate bars. It includes details about the company, country of origin, cocoa percentage, and ratings. Before diving into the analysis, let’s have a look at some key variables in the dataset:\n\nCompany/Manufacturer: The name of the company/brand and the manufacturer of the chocolate bar.\nCompany Location: The country where the company is based.\nCocoa Percentage: The percentage of cocoa content in the chocolate.\nRating: A numerical rating between 1 and 5, indicating the quality of the chocolate bar.\nReview Date: The year in which the chocolate bar was reviewed.\n\nTo ensure the quality of the dataset for analysis, cleaning data steps were performed following the code chunk below:\n\n# Load the dataset\nchocolate_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/chocolate.csv\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(cocoa_percent = as.numeric(str_remove(cocoa_percent, \"%\"))) %&gt;%  # Remove the \"%\" for data wrangling\n  mutate(review_date = as.Date(paste0(review_date, \"-01-01\"))) %&gt;% # Assuming year is the only component \n  distinct() %&gt;% # Removed duplicate entries to avoid biased results\n  filter(!is.na(rating) & !is.na(cocoa_percent)) # Filtered out rows with missing values, in the `rating` and `cocoa_percent` columns\n\nFirstly, my analysis focus on top chocolate companies based on their average ratings. For this, I filtered out companies with fewer than 10 reviews and considered top 20 ratings to ensure the high quality of the chocolates. From Table 1 showing the top 20 companies with their average scores, we can infer that Idilio and Soma are standout premium chocolate companies, each maintaining a consistent average rating above 3.5.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Top 20 Ratings of Chocolate Brands\n\n\n\n\nTop 20 Ratings of Chocolate Brands\n\n\nChocolate Brand\nAverage Score\n\n\n\n\nIdilio\n3.78\n\n\nSoma\n3.59\n\n\nBrasstown aka It’s Chocolate\n3.55\n\n\nHeirloom Cacao Preservation\n3.55\n\n\nPotomac\n3.55\n\n\nRitual\n3.54\n\n\nArete\n3.53\n\n\nSmooth Chocolator, The\n3.51\n\n\nDomori\n3.50\n\n\nDick Taylor\n3.49\n\n\nBonnat\n3.47\n\n\nFriis Holm\n3.45\n\n\nMarou\n3.45\n\n\nDuffy’s\n3.44\n\n\nFruition\n3.43\n\n\nLetterpress\n3.43\n\n\nA. Morin\n3.42\n\n\nFresco\n3.42\n\n\nRogue\n3.42\n\n\nPierre Marcolini\n3.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then examined whether there was a relationship between cocoa percentage and the chocolate ratings. Interestingly, Figure 1 shows a negative trend: higher cocoa content tends to be associated with lower ratings. This suggests that consumers would prefer chocolates with a balanced flavor, and other ingredients besides cocoa content also play a crucial role in customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship Between Cocoa Percentage and Rating\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking into account local preferences, I analyzed chocolate brands originating from Australia and Colombia, since there are only few chocolate brands from other nationalities in Carnegie (India, China, Greece, Malysia, etc.) and they are not highly rated. Brands from Australia and Colombia in Figure 2 consistently ranked high in terms of quality and ratings, suggesting that stocking chocolates from these countries would be well-aligned with the tastes of our local customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Chocolate Ratings based on Local Resident Nationality\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, this analysis provides several meaningful insights. Stocking premium chocolate brands like Idilio and Soma could greatly benefit our store due to their consistent high ratings and reputations. Additionally, chocolates with a balanced cocoa content would be more preferable rather than those with an excessively high percentage. Finally, including top-rated chocolates from Australia and Colombia would likely resonate with our local customer base, enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing sales.\n\nReferences\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics - Carnegie 2021. https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/SAL20498.\nFlavors of Cacao. https://flavorsofcacao.com/."
